On this repository we published the work that we did in 1st Hackathon BioDataUCO at the University of Córdoba in Course 20/21. These activity consisted of soving a daily challenge.

For which we first had load the data on our work-space, then we had to choose between R and Python to analize the data. We choose R and we used google collab to work simultaneusly. Once we have procesed the data we try to tire conclusions.
